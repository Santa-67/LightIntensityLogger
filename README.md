The Light Intensity Logger is a simple console-based Java application that simulates the process of logging light intensity readings using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). 
The program generates random LDR values between 0-1023, simulates timestamps, and stores these readings in a text file (light_data.txt). 
Users can view the logged readings, search them by date, and generate new readings.
